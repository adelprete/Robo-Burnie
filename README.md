Scripts for the reddit bot 'RoboBurnie' to update the r/heat subreddit

As of writing this, these python scripts do the following:
* **post_game_thread.py** - Once a Miami Heat game is finished, a new thread will be created for Post Game discussion.  
This script is ran once a day at 2pm and finishes once the game for that day is over.
* **standings.py** - Every day at 4am EST this script is ran to update the Eastern Conference Standings on the sidebar of the New Reddit version of this subreddit.
